# Poker AI Project  
This was the first Computer Project for Discrete Mathematics Spring 2014.
My partner was Kyle Cavorley, and this was coded using C++.

The project dynamically generates a random deck and features draw, shuffle, and other various deck commands.
The project also contains algorithms to detect the winner of a round, as well as a very simple AI to play against.
